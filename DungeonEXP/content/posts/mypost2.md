Over the last year I have had quite the rollercoaster ride when striving to rid my organizations network of as many vulnerabilities as possible for the sake of meeting compliance standards. Learning, mastering and fully Utilizing Security Center along that journey has given me invaluable lessons in network security and streamlining the process as a whole. There is a wealth of options and functionalities to be employed spanning from the customizable dashboards, great for feeding you relevant data as soon as you open the application to the reporting capability that we primarily used for uploading to external repositories for auditing purposes. All of the days that I spent shadowing other security technicians before I could actually dive into the scanning and patching cycle seem absurd now given that the routine feels almost second nature at this point. I actually for some odd reason quite enjoy going into the analysis tab and just reading the vulnerability details page, not because I'm happy about more vulnerability after running scans but because it showed that there was always something new to be worked on and a plethora of knowledge and skills yet to be attained.
Here are two of my favorite attributes of Security Center.

1.) Assurance Report Cards: Mainly because it provides good but simple evaluation benchmarks to strive for.

2.) Solutions Targeted Assets: This is a good component primarily because it allows you to quickly dig deep into a specific system or asset grouping while providing a risk reduction percentage that you can use to better prioritize which vulnerabilities should be patched first.
